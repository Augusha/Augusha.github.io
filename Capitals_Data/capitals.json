It is the smallest internationally recognized independent state in the world by both area and population, having an area of approximately 49 hectares (121 acres) and a population of just over 800 people. Vatican City is the seat of the Roman Catholic Church, the world's largest Christian church. The Pope is the head of state of the Vatican City and the supreme leader of the Catholic Church. The Vatican City was established in 1929 with the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy. The treaty ended the Roman Question, a dispute between the papacy and Italy that had lasted for over half a century. The Vatican City is a sovereign state and is not part of Italy. It has its own flag, currency, and postal service.",
